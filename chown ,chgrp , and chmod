chmod 0775 will disable sticky bit
chmod 0+t add sticky bit to subdirectory
chmod 0-t remove sticky bit from subdirectory
# SUID = Set User ID = Tells Linux to run the program with the permissions of whoever owns the file raher that the user who runs the program
#The SUID and SGID are special permission bits. SUID (Set owner User ID up on execution) is a special type of file permissions given to a file. Normally in Linux/Unix when a program runs, it inherits access permissions from the logged in user. SUID is defined as giving temporary permissions to a user to run a program/file with the permissions of the file owner rather that the user who runs it. SGID permission is similar to the SUID permission, the only difference is â€“ when the script or command with SGID on is run, it runs as if it were a member of the same group in which the file is a member. 

# Set Group ID SGID = Sets the group of the running program to the group of the file

chmod 4775 file   4 to set the SUID bit
chmod 2775 file  2 to set the SGID bit
chmod 6775 file  6 to set both bits
# Set by symbolic code 
chmod u+s file   4 to set the SUID bit
chmod g+s file  2 to set the SGID bit
chmod ug file  6 to set both bits
